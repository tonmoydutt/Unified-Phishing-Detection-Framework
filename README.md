# 📘 Unified Phishing Detection Framework  
### *A Multi-Model Approach Using ML and User Input Integration*

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project:  
**“Unified Phishing Detection Framework: A Multi-Model Approach with Ensembled Methods & User Input Integration.”**

This work focuses on designing a hybrid phishing detection system that combines:

- Machine Learning–based detection  
- Lexical and domain-based feature extraction  
- User-driven evaluation  
- Multi-model ensemble classification  

The goal is to improve phishing detection accuracy while keeping the system interpretable and practical for real-world use.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Develop a multi-model ML pipeline for phishing website & email classification  
- Combine automated analysis with user verification to reduce false positives  
- Compare multiple ML models (LR, RF, SVM, GB) for performance  
- Build a unified framework that integrates ML + human interpretation  

---

## 🔍 Features
- ✔️ URL lexical feature extraction  
- ✔️ Domain-based and content-based analysis  
- ✔️ Ensemble ML classification  
- ✔️ User input verification module  
- ✔️ Model performance comparison & evaluation  
- ✔️ Python-based reproducible implementation
